  The consumer script uses multiple worker threads to consume from the Kafka topic “tweets,” decode Avro messages, and write to InfluxDB.

  Data Storage Strategy: Research suggests storing aggregated sentiment counts, rather than individual tweets, for efficiency. Each tweet’s sentiment and timestamp can be tagged, and counts aggregated every second, reducing write operations. This approach aligns with InfluxDB’s strengths for time-series aggregation, as detailed in InfluxDB Time Series Data.

  involves two I/O operations—reading from Kafka and writing to InfluxDB—but you’ve optimized it by aggregating sentiment counts, reducing write overhead.reducing write overhead. Data generation has one I/O (Kafka write), but generating unique IDs and serializing each message can slow it down.

  Optimization in Ingestion: The consumer script aggregates sentiment counts, writing fewer points to InfluxDB (e.g., counts per second per sentiment), reducing write overhead. This is more efficient than generation, which must serialize and send each tweet individually, including generating unique IDs and handling Avro serialization, as seen in the producer’s generateBatch function. This efficiency is supported by InfluxDB Time Series Data, which recommends aggregation for high-throughput scenarios.

  I/O Efficiency: Data generation has one I/O (Kafka write), but the overhead of generating unique IDs (e.g., crypto.randomUUID()) and serializing each message can slow it down. In contrast, ingestion reads from Kafka (fast with large fetch sizes) and writes to InfluxDB in batches, leveraging InfluxDB’s write performance optimizations.





  User Interface Considerations
The pie chart is good for snapshot views, but adding a line chart for trends and a bar chart for comparisons will create a standard dashboard layout, similar to tools like Google Analytics.
For fun elements, consider popups with animations (e.g., using libraries like Anime.js) for alerts, making the MVP more engaging.
